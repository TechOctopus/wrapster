### Message from dbrand:

Hey Heorhi!

Thanks for your patience; we're experiencing significantly higher ticket volume. Provided it's solely for educational purposes and you are in no way earning money from said project, it shouldn't be an issue if you wish to use assets from our website for it. We appreciate you taking the time to reach out and ask. Let us know if there's anything else we can help with and have a great day!
Signed,
A Robot
